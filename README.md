## Projects

### 1. Hotel Management Project

<details>
    <summary>Info</summary>
        I started this project as a school submission, but as I got into it, I found it increasingly challenging, and I enjoyed that. It pushed me to my limits, and after that experience, I never felt quite as pushed again. While it's still not perfect, I plan to perfect it someday. As of April 19, 2025, there are three versions of the project, two of which are completed and uploaded. I plan to release the final version after some time. The reason for the existence of a third version is simple: the first version was for personal practice, the second was to showcase some of my skills (and was made before the first one), and the third version will be the most recent, albeit the most bare-bones, as the school only allows basic Python. After all, it's important for practical marks, so I will purposely keep the third version simple. I plan to complete this final version during the summer break of 12th grade (June 2025).

### 2. YouTube Clone - 2022/2023

        This is a simple YouTube clone I created as the final project for a YouTube course focused solely on HTML and CSS. While the course taught a lot, it didn't cover everything (which is expected from a 7-hour course). Still, for what it was, it was a good learning experience. I plan to work on an updated version of this project after learning JavaScript.
